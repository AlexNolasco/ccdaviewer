# C-CDA Viewer for iOS

C-CDA viewer is an iOS application for viewing C-CDAs on the iPhone or iPad developed as part of the C-CDA Rendering Tool Challenge - HL7.
---

C-CDA viewer for iOS is a native application written in
Objective-C.  It consists of two projects, a C-CDA parser and
a viewer.
The parser extracts what it considers to be “necessary” from
specific sections and maps the information to simpler
objects for the viewer to display.
